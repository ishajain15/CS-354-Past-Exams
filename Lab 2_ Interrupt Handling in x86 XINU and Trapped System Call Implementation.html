<h2>1. Objectives</h2>
The objectives of this lab are to understand XINU's basic interrupt handling
on x86 Galileo backends for synchronous interrupts: source of interrupt is either an exception
(also called fault) or software interrupt int.
We will then utilize the int instruction to change XINU system calls from regular
function calls into
trapped system calls, which follows the traditional method for implementing systems calls
in Linux and Windows on x86 computers.

Please use a fresh copy of XINU, xinu-spring2022.tar.gz, but for preserving
the mygreeting() function from lab1 and removing all code related to xsh from main() (i.e.,
you are starting with an empty main() before adding code to perform testing). 
As noted before, main() serves as an app

<h2>3. Custom handling of synchronous x86 interrupts [90 pts]</h2>

<p>
Sections 3.1-3.4 describe background for coding problems in sections
3.5-3.7.
As noted in class,
volume of coding is minimal. This allows focusing on logic and implementation
details to arrive at quality code that is correct and efficient.
</p>

<h3>3.1 Example: invalid opcode exception</h3>

<p>
Although gcc is unlikely to generate machine code that triggers an invalid opcode exception which
is a synchronous interrupt (i.e., "synchronous" in the sense that an instruction of the current
process is the cause), writing assembly code or embedding assembly in C code can result
in interrupt number 6 if not careful. One case is accessing x86 control 
registers CR0-CR8, some of which are reserved. For example, embedding
<br>
<br>
asm("movl %ebx, %cr1");
<br>
<br>
into C code that tries to copy the content of EBX to CR1 will result in interrupt number 6.
The operation as a whole comprised of opcode
and operand is considered invalid. Trying to use a general-purpose register such as
%EAF which does not exist is detected by gcc. CR1 exists but is not used in x86, a
condition that is not checked by gcc. 
</p>

<p>
Modifying the content of control registers is
part of the task performed by operating system kernels and associated system tools. 
For example, during bootloading x86's protected mode that separates kernel mode/user mode
is enabled by setting the PE bit (first bit) of CR0 to 1. In the graduate version of
CS354, CS503, the last lab assignment involves a 5-week virtual memory lab where paging
-- a topic we will discuss in the second half of the course -- is enabled after bootloading by
setting the PG bit (last bit of CR0) to 1. Our XINU version runs with paging disabled,
i.e., PG = 0.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Example: divide-by-zero exception</h3>

<p>
x86 generates a divide-by-zero exception or fault, which is interrupt number 0, if
an instruction tries to divide a number by zero. For example, C code
</p><pre>int main() { int x; x = x / 0; }
</pre>
when translated into machine code will trigger divide-by-zero exception. As discussed
in the lectures, the first entry in IDT set up by XINU during system initialization
(the same goes for Linux and Windows)
for interrupt number 0 will contain a function pointer to an interrupt handler that
x86 will jump to. 
<p></p>

<h3>3.3 Operating system response to synchronous interrupts</h3>

<p>
For most synchronous interrupts, when an operating system is informed of the interrupt
by hardware, the default action is to terminate the offending process. For some interrupts,
an operating system may provide processes (hence app programmer)
the flexibility to deal with the interrupt without
terminating the process. This will be the subject of a later lab which corresponds
to signal handling in Linux/UNIX. A similar feature also exists in Windows.
In the default XINU, interrupt numbers 0 and 6 on our x86 Galileo backends results in termination 
of the current process. In Problem 3, we will modify how XINU deals with interrupt number
6 which involves understanding the interrupt handling interface between hardware and software,
and coding software so that x86 does what we want it to do.
</p>

<h3>3.4 Modifying how XINU deals with synchronous interrupts</h3>

<p>
<b>
Two methods of triggering synchronous interrupts.
</b>
We will consider two methods for triggering synchronous interrupts.
The first
method we have already encountered in 3.1 where an invalid operation, "movl %ebx, %cr1",
where the MOV instructions tries to access CR1 is the cause. In the second method,
we can use the x86 instruction, int, called software interrupt to generate the invalid
opcode exception. From C code we embed inline assembly code
<br>
<br>
asm("int $6");
<br>
<br>
which executes instruction int with operand value 6,
thus generating exception 6. In a similar vein, divide-by-zero exception can be triggered by
an ALU instruction that actually tries to divide by 0 or by executing
instruction, int $0. The software interrupt int has several uses, one of which is
to use as a trap instruction to switch from user code to kernel code. Its counterpart,
iret, allows untrapping from kernel mode to user mode.
</p>

<p>
<b>
IDT setup in XINU.
</b>
XINU's interface to x86's interrupts is through a data structure,
IDT (interrupt descriptor table), through which hardware and software mutually interface. IDT
is set up by XINU (same goes for Linux and Windows running on x86), and x86 consults
IDT to determine which kernel code to run when an interrupt is generated. The
7'th entry of IDT (interrupt numbers start at 0) is configured to contain a function
pointer to XINU's interrupt handling code, _Xint6, for dealing with interrupt number 6.
That is, when interrupt number 6 is generated x86 will jump to _Xint6 whose code
is located in system/intr.S.
Similarly for interrupt number 0 which causes a jump to interrupt handling code _Xint0.
<br><br>
When we examine assembly code intr.S we find that instructions at _Xint6 cause a jump to Xtrap
(also in intr.S) which then calls C function trap() located in system/evec.c. Xtrap
which is coded in assembly passes two arguments to C function
trap() following CDECL. The first
argument is the interrupt number. _Xint6 knows the value 6 since
it is pointed by the 7'th entry of IDT and thus is executing.
The second argument is a pointer to the saved stack pointer field
in the process table which specifies the top of the stack of a
process that is not current. trap() outputs
the interrupt number, PID, and a number of other state variables which can be 
helpful when debugging run-time errors. 
Then trap calls panic() (in system/panic.c) which enters an infinite while-loop.
That is the reason a backend machine hangs indefinitely after exception 13
(general protection fault), a common x86 exception you will encounter
during debugging.
</p>

<p>
<b>
x86 interrupt handling in XINU.
</b>
For exception 0 our goal is to modify _Xint0 so that it does not call Xtrap but returns control
(i.e., jumps) back to the process that triggered the divide-by-zero exception by executing iret.
Specifically, we want _Xint0 to jump to the instruction of the current process
that comes next to the divide-by-zero instruction that triggered exception 0. 
For some synchronous interrupts such as
page fault (i.e., accessing content in main memory fails
because it resides on disk and must be copied into main memory), 
we want to return to the same instruction that caused the page fault interrupt so that
it can be repeated. Executing the memory access instruction a second time will succeed
since the missing content has been brought into main memory.
For divide-by-zero, returning to the same instruction that triggered exception 0
would cause an infinite loop of exception 0 interrupts.
We want the process to move on to the next instruction.
In Linux signal handlers, we want _Xint0 to jump to user code
-- i.e., signal handler (or callback function in Windows) -- 
that a programmer has asked Linux to jump to when
divide-by-zero occurs. Linux supports signal handling for
exception 0 via the SIGFPE signal but does not support signal handling for
exception 6. 
<br><br>
In the case of exception 6,
jumping back to the address of instruction "movl %ebx, %cr1"
is achieved with hardware support. It was noted
in class that x86 pushes onto the stack of the current process the
content of EFLAGS, CS, and EIP registers. For some interrupts, an error
code may be pushed after EIP to convey additional information.
The first register, EFLAGS, contains
state information of the current process which must be saved onto the
process's stack since kernel interrupt handling code (i.e., _Xint6) may
change the bits of EFLAGS. Before jumping back to the code of the interrupted
process, the original content of EFLAGS must be restored. The same goes for
CS which specifies whether the process was running in user mode/kernel mode
before generating the interrupt. The most important piece is the program
counter, EIP, which contains the address to jump back to. 
x86 specifies for which exceptions EIP points to the next instruction, and
for which instructions EIP points to the same instruction that triggered the
exception. For both divide-by-zero
and invalid opcode exceptions, the latter holds.
Hence to jump to the next instruction and not the instruction that triggered
the exception, we must modify the value of EIP that was pushed onto the
stack before executing iret.
</p>


<h3>3.5 Returning from x86 synchronous interrupts</h3>

<p>
Modify the code at _Xint0 and _Xint6 so that all that they do is execute iret.
Since x86 pushed the content of EFLAGS, CS, and EIP registers onto the run-time
stack atomically when exception 0 or 6 occurred
and ESP points to the top of the stack, executing iret will have the reverse
effect of atomically popping the saved values of EIP, CS, EFLAGS on the stack
and restoring the original content of the EIP, CS, and EFLAGS registers.
Since the EIP value pushed onto the stack by x86 for exceptions 0 and 6 is
the address of the instruction that triggered the exception, this will result
in an infinite loop of exceptions. That is, in the case of "movl %ebx, %cr1"
that generates the invalid opcode exception, it will be executed again and
again. Hence whatever instruction follows "movl %ebx, %cr1" will not be
executed. Verify that this is indeed the case for both exceptions. First, check
that legacy _Xint0 and _Xint6 cause trap() to be called and state information to
be output before hanging forever due to the infinite while-loop of
panic(). Include the output you observe in your write-up
lab2.pdf under lab2/. Second, modify _Xint0 and _Xint6 so that it increments
a global variable, int interruptcounter, initialized to 0 in initialize.c. If
the value is greater than 1000, it calls function, void checkintcounter(void),
in system/checkintcounter.C, which prints interruptcounter and returns.
Remember to add new function definitions to include/prototypes.h.
After checkintcounter() returns, _Xint0 and _Xint6 execute iret.
In test code main(), insert code after asm("movl %ebx, %cr1") to verify that
it is never reached. Do the same for divide-by-zero C code of 3.2. Discuss
what you find in lab2.pdf. Make sure to consider where ESP points to in
the stack after checkcounter() returns.
For any XINU source code that you modified create
a subdirectory v1/ under lab2/ and place the files in v1/. For example,
if you modified intr.S to test that an infinite loop occurs, place
the modified file intr.S in v1/. Also, put a copy of your test code
main.c in v1/ so that the TAs can check what testing you performed.
In addition to your main.c, the TAs will use their own main() to
evaluate your code.
</p>

<h3>3.6 Returning from x86 software interrupt int</h3>

<p>
Modifying _Xint0 and _Xint6 so that they return to the next
instruction and not result in an infinite loop will be tackled
in 3.7. Here we will make use of software interrupt, int, to artificially
generate exceptions 0 and 6 by embedding inline assembly
asm("int $0") or asm("int $6") in main(). Although executing "int $0"
has the same effect as dividing by 0 and generates exception 0, 
a subtle but important difference is that the
EIP value pushed by x86 onto the stack is that of the next instruction.
The same goes for "int $6" which triggers the invalid opcode exception.
Hence when testing the same intr.S code as 3.5, by inspecting the value
of the global variable interruptcounter after the inline assembly code
you can verify that iret executed by _Xint0 and _Xint6 return to the
next instruction in main().
Create subdirectory v2/ under lab2/ and put your test code main.c in
v2/. Describe your finding in lab2.pdf.
</p>

<h3>3.7 Returning to the next instruction by manipulating return address in the stack</h3>

<p>
In 3.5 because x86 pushed the address of the instruction that generated the
divide-by-zero or invalid opcode exception, executing iret returned to the same
instruction causing an infinite loop. In 3.6 we were able to return to the
next instruction because software interrupt int caused x86 to push the next
instruction onto the run-time stack. Here we will modify the return address
pushed by x86 in 3.5 so that its value is that of the next instruction.
In general, modifying the address to jump to the next instruction can be
simple or involved. In contrast to ARM processors with fixed
instruction lengths, x86 has variable length instructions that complicates
determining the offset to add to the return address pushed on the stack
to return to the next instruction. Our focus is not becoming expert in x86
instruction format and finding efficient means for determining offsets in general. 
For our purpose of practicing return oriented programming (ROI) relevant 
for coding operating systems, we will use trial-and-error by adding different 
offset values to the return address on the stack and checking if it works.
When implementing certain operating system features, we will be overwriting
return addresses with specific function pointers where knowing the location of
return addresses on the stack is important.
</p>

<p>
Copy the code of 3.5 in v1/ to a subdirectory new v3/. Then modify the return
address pushed by x86 on the stack in _Xint0 and _Xint6 by adding different
offset values. Start by adding 1 (offset of 1 byte) and continue by increasing
the offset until you find the first offset that works. Describe in lab2.pdf
what happens until you find the right offset.

<h2>4. Trapped XINU system calls [150 pts]</h2>

<p>
As discussed in the lectures and evident by inspection of any XINU system call code,
all XINU system calls are
regular C function calls. That is, there is no special trap instruction that
switches a process from user mode to kernel mode and jumps to a kernel function
in the upper half of the kernel to carry out the requested service.
A system call in XINU is not a wrapper function that acts as a gateway to a
kernel function that actually performs the tasks of a system call. Instead, it is the actual
kernel function.
</p>

<p>
Isolation/protection is a core feature of
commodity operating systems such as Linux and Windows necessary
for reliability. It is essential for security.
Not supporting isolation/protection in special computing environments
is the exception to the rule. We will re-implement two XINU system
calls -- chprio() and getprio() -- into trapped
versions using a traditional technique used in Linux and Windows 
for x86 machines. chprio() changes the priority of a process to a
specific value, and getprio() returns the priority of a specific
process.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Traditional system call trap using int instruction in Linux and Windows</h3>

<p>
The traditional approach followed by Linux and Windows on x86 to implement trapped
system calls is to use software interrupt int to transition from
user mode to kernel mode and jump to kernel code in the upper half that performs
the requested service. To return back to user mode after the task has
been complete, the iret instruction is executed which jumps back to user code in
user mode and
continues where the process left off. 
For example, in Linux the fork() system call
is a wrapper function (part of the C standard library) that performs a trap,
and sys_fork() is the kernel function that calls other kernel functions
to accomplish the requested task of spawning a child process.
When the wrapper function fork() traps, i.e., executes the int instruction,
it does not directly jump to sys_fork() but goes through an intermediary --
the system call dispatcher -- that determines which system call service is being
requested and jumps to the relevant kernel function sys_fork().
The traditional method for system call trap using int/iret has been supplanted
by sysenter/sysexit instructions in Intel x86 CPUs which improves efficiency over 
the traditional method. The traditional method is relevant for understanding
the optimized method and also as a pedagogical tool due to its transparency.
</p>

<h3>4.2 XINU system call dispatcher _Xint40</h3>

<p>
The operand of software interrupt int specifies the interrupt number that indexes
the IDT.
In Linux, interrupt number 128 is used to install the system call dispatcher in
IDT, whereas in Windows interrupt number 40 is used. System calls are numbered 0, 1, 2, 
... to identify them inside the kernel.
Register EAX is used to pass the system call number from a system call
wrapper function to system call dispatcher.
In XINU, we will use interrupt number 40 to install a system call dispatcher.
That is, the 43rd entry in IDT will contain the function pointer of the system
call dispatcher.
Interrupt 40 is not used in XINU hence we
can repurpose _Xint40 in intr.S by modifying its code to perform the 
chores of a system call dispatcher.
Interrupt numbers 0, 1, ..., 31 are reserved in x86 for exceptions.
XINU uses interrupt number 32 to service clock interrupts.
Any of unused interrupt numbers can be used to trap to the system call dispatcher.
</p>

<p>
Arguments of a system call, if any,
are communicated from system call wrapper function to system call dispatcher
through registers and stack.
chprio() has two arguments, getprio() has one.
The first argument we will pass in register ECX. The second argument, if there
is one, we will pass through the stack.
Upon executing "int $40" in the wrapper function, x86 will push EFLAGS, CS, EIP
on the stack and jump to _Xint40.
Wrapper functions will communicate to _Xint40 which system call is being called
through EAX. For chprio(), 10 will be placed in EAX and system call number 11
will be used to identify getprio(). Any other value passed through EAX will be considered
invalid by the system call dispatcher which will put -1 in EAX and execute iret. 
The system call wrapper function coded in C can then return to its caller (e.g., 
test function main()) which checks the return value of the wrapper function
(i.e., value in EAX by CDECL) to note that the system call failed.
</p>

<p>
After checking that the value in EAX passed by a system call wrapper function
is valid, _Xint40 will push system call arguments (one for getprio() and two for
chprio()) onto the stack and
conditionally jump to getprio() or chprio(). We will reuse and treat existing
XINU system calls which are regular C functions as internal kernel functions that
perform the requested task. For example, in Linux internal kernel function
do_fork() carries out the actual work of spawning a child process. Since
getprio() and chprio() are translated into machine code by gcc following CDECL,
when calling them from _Xint40 we must abide by CDECL so that caller/callee
interaction works correctly. Moreover, getprio() and chprio() will return
values in EAX per CDECL. Since the return values from getprio() and chprio()
must be communicated back to their wrapper functions, the intermediary _Xint40 must not modify
EAX before executing iret. The wrapper functions coded in C are translated by gcc,
hence will expect
return values in EAX. Wrapper functions which act as system call APIs, in turn, 
return to their caller (e.g., test function main()) with return value stored in EAX.
The above is an application of ABI programming practiced in lab1.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Three software layers for implementing trapped system calls</h3>

<p>
When implementing trapped system calls we need to handle three layers
of software. First, system call wrapper functions that act as system call API for app
programmers (part of C standard library in Linux)
to invoke operating system services. For example, fork()
which is part of the C standard library is such a wrapper function.
This will be elaborated in 4.4. Second, system
call dispatcher code (in our case _Xint40 in intr.S) to which system call wrapper
functions trap to. This was discussed in 4.2. Third, the internal kernel
functions that actually perform requested kernel services.
In our case, they are the existing XINU
system call functions getprio() and chprio() that are called by _Xint40.
The third layer is coded in C (getprio() and chprio()), the
second layer (_Xint40) is coded in assembly, and the first layer discussed 
in 4.4 is coded in a mix of C and assembly.
The interfaces between the three software layers
must be carefully implemented so that the resultant interaction
works seamlessly.
</p>


<h3>4.4 System call wrapper functions: general design</h3>

<p>
In Linux, fork() is a system call wrapper function (part of
glibc on our frontend lab machines) that acts as the system call API 
for app programmers. It
traps to the system call dispatcher which
then calls internal kernel functions to carry out the work of spawning a child
process. The same three layers as in our XINU trapped system call set-up.
We will code two wrapper functions,
syscall xgetprio(pid32), in xgetprio.c, and pri16 xchprio(pid32, pri16), in
xchprio.c, both under system/. An app programmer will call xgetprio() to
invoke the kernel service getprio(), 
and analogously for xchprio() to change the
priority of a specific process. getprio() and chprio() which are regular C functions
will be repurposed as internal kernel functions. For example, an app process
with statement
</p><pre>x = xchprio(6, 29);
</pre>
in its C code is requesting that XINU set the priority of the process with PID 6
to 29. xchprio() returns -1 if the system call fails, or the old priority value of
the process if it succeeds.
xchprio() traps to the kernel's system call dispatcher _Xint40 which calls
internal kernel function chprio() to carry out the actual work.
In general, kernel code that implements system calls such as xchprio() contain
privileged operations that can only be performed in kernel mode. Hence
calling do_fork() in Linux from app code in user mode will fail since its execution
will involve one or more privileged operations (e.g., updating the process table
in kernel memory) that require kernel mode.
<p></p>


<h3>4.5 System call wrapper functions: xchprio() and xgetprio()</h3>

<p>
We will code system call wrapper functions in C with inline assembly
to effect passing of system call arguments (register EAX and stack).
Code xchprio() in xchprio.c and xgetprio() in xgetprio.c, both in system/.
We encountered a simple form of inline assembly in 3.4 where we embedded assembly
instruction, "int $6", inside C function main() using asm("int $6") to
generate a software interrupt for the invalid opcode exception. Except in very
simple cases that require no communication of values between C and embedded
inline assembly code, we will need to use a richer framework for embedding
assembly code in C code called extended inline assembly. xgetprio()
has one argument and returns a value of type syscall (i.e., int32). Extended
inline assembly allows values to be communicated between C variables
and registers in assembly code.
In general, extended assembly may involve passing of
arguments and execution of multiple instructions which require careful
specification following extended asm() syntax so that the embedded assembly
code does not conflict with the surrounding assembly code generated by gcc
when translating the C code of xgetprio(). 
</p>

<p>
In the case of extended inline assembly code inserted in xgetprio() C code,
before executing instruction, int $40, we will need to store the system call number 
11 which identifies xgetprio() in register EAX needed by _Xint40.
When _Xint40 returns to the next instruction of xgetprio()
by executing iret, we may need to copy the return value contained in EAX to 
a local C variable of xgetprio() if further operations on the returned value
are performed by xgetprio(). If not, leaving the value untouched in EAX
may suffice since the CDECL caller/callee interface between main() and
xgetprio() expects xgetprio() to put its return value in EAX.
In general, extended inline assembly follows the format
<br><br>
asm(assembler template
<br>
   : output operands
<br>
   : input operands
<br>
   : clobbered registers);
<br><br>
The last component, clobbered registers, is a list of registers that the extended
inline assembly code may be modifying. When embedding the extended inline assembly code,
this information will be used to save/restore, or avoid if possible, these registers
in the surrounding assembly code generated by gcc from the C code of xgetprio().
</p>

<p>
For our purpose, it is best to start with simple examples with references
(<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/manuals.html">html</a>)
serving as a more comprehensive guide when needed.
For example, assuming system call number for xgetprio() is stored in local
C variable, int sysnumb, and the value returned by _Xint40 in EAX is to be copied
to local C variable, int retnum, asm()'s input operands would specify
"a"(sysnumb) meaning that the value in C variable sysnumb should be stored in
EAX. This comprises the input part. For output operands of asm(), we would
specify "=a"(retnum) meaning that the content of EAX is to be copied into C
variable retnum. 
Coding of extended inline assembly for CS354 is minimal involving but a
few lines of code.
Verify that xgetprio() and xchprio() work correctly by calling them from main().
</p>

<h3>4.6 Trapped system call implementation remains in kernel mode</h3>

<p>
Trapped system calls xgetprio() and
xchprio() follow the general framework for implementing trapped system calls in
Linux and Window in x86 with one caveat: when trapping by executing "int $40" in
system call wrapper functions to _Xint40 via x86's IDT, we did not switch stacks.
Nor did we concern ourselves with the CPL bits of the CS register which will
specify whether the current process runs in kernel mode (00) or user mode (11).
In legacy XINU all processes start in kernel mode and the same run-time stack
is used when running app code and kernel code. A full-fledged implementation of
trapped system calls in XINU would necessitate starting processes in user mode,
saving and restoring CS, DS, SS registers when trapping and untrapping, and
switching stacks when transitioning between user mode and kernel mode.
These modifications are not difficult but require additional background on
x86 hardware support and coding to interface with hardware.
Since CS354 is an undergraduate introductory operating system course, we will
exclude the full-fledged features from the scope of our trapped
system call implementation.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>


<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>

<p>
If you are unsure what you need to submit in what format, consult the
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hill341/ta-notes.html">TA notes</a> link.
If it doesn't answer your question, ask during PSOs and office hours which are
scheduled M-F.

<p>
Specific instructions:
</p>

<p>
1. Format for submitting written lab answers and kprintf() added for 
testing and debugging purposes in kernel code:
</p><ul>
<li>
Provide your answers to the questions below in lab2.pdf and
place the file in lab2/. You may use any document editing software
but your final output must be exported and submitted as a pdf file.
</li>
<li>
For problems where you are asked to print values using kprintf(), use
conditional compilation (C preprocessor directives #define combined with #if and #endif)
with macro XINUTEST (in include/process.h) to effect
print/no print depending on if
XINUTEST is defined or not. For your debug statements, do the same with macro XINUDEBUG.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
2. Before submitting your work, make sure to double-check the
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hill341/ta-notes.html">TA Notes</a>
to ensure that any additional requirements and instructions have been followed.
</p>

<p>3. Electronic turn-in instructions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i) Go to the xinu-spring2022/compile
directory and run "make clean".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) Go to the directory where lab2 (containing
xinu-spring2022/ and lab2.pdf) is a subdirectory. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, if /homes/alice/cs354/lab2/xinu-spring2022 is your directory structure, go to 
/homes/alice/cs354
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii) Type the following command
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
turnin -c cs354 -p lab2 lab2</p>
<p></p>
<p>
You can check/list the submitted files using
<br><br>
turnin -c cs354 -p lab2 -v
</p>


<p>
<i>Please make sure to disable all debugging output before submitting your code.</i>
