<h2>1. Objectives</h2>
The objectives of this lab are to instrument XINU to
monitor resource consumption and performance
of processes, monitor and classify the behavior of processes 
to balance the needs of CPU- and I/O-bound processes
to achieve equitable sharing of resources during dynamic priority scheduling.

<h2>3. Monitoring process CPU usage [80 pts]</h2>

<h3>3.1 Total CPU usage and utilization</h3>

<p>
We will reuse the global variable, int interruptcounter, from Problem 3.5 in lab2 to
implement a system timer that keeps track of CPU time since bootloading
at the millisecond granularity.
To do that, modify clkdisp.S so that interruptcounter is incremented before calling
clkhandler(). 
To monitor CPU usage of the current process, we will introduce another
global variable, int current_cputime, declared in initialize.c that is used to
keep track of CPU usage of the current process (in msec unit) since it was
context-switched in. As with interruptcounter, current_cputime is incremented in 
clkdisp.S. To monitor total CPU usage of a process since its creation, we will
define a new process table field, uint32 prtotcpu, initialized to 0 when a process
is created that is updated when a process is context-switched out. For prtotcpu
to be an accurate tally of CPU usage of the current process we must add 
current_cputime. To support querying of total CPU usage by app processes,
implement a new system call, syscall cpuusage(pid32 pid), in system/cpuusage.c that returns CPU
usage of the process given by the argument. Upon error, cpuusage() returns
SYSERR. In lab3.pdf explain the limitations of cpuusage(). For testing purposes
in CS354 where a run does not last more than tens of seconds
they will not surface as an issue. In a production system they will be a
problem that needs to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
We will also support querying of CPU utilization by implementing a system call,
uint32 cpuutil(void), in system/cpuutil.c that returns an integer in the range 
0-100 that specifies the percentage of CPU time since bootloading that was
spent doing useful activities. By default, "useful" will mean not running the 
idle/NULL process.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Current process CPU usage</h3>

<p>
To monitor CPU usage of the current process, we need to consider what needs to
happen when a process is context-switched in and context-switched out. In the
latter, the "old" process's current_cputime must be added to its process table
field prtotcpu. In the former, after the old process's total CPU usage has
been updated, current_cputime must be reset to 0 so that the new process's
CPU usage can be tallied. Updating of current_cputime
is performed by clkdisp.S in 3.1. Explain in lab3.pdf where this is best
done in XINU code. Consider the fact that the new process being context-switched
in may have occupied the CPU before or is running for the very first time.
Note whether this matters or not. Also consider that the idle process is not
spawned using create() but "handcrafted" when the kernel is initialized.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Testing and verification of correctness</h3>

<p>
Testing and verifying that software runs correctly is arguably the most
challenging part of software engineering, not coding per se. An operating
system that manages hardware and app processes running on the hardware is
a complex system. Even what appear to be straightforward modifications
such as monitoring CPU usage require careful consideration to establish
that the software changes work as intended, i.e., correctly.
In complex real-world systems such as operating systems, it is next to 
impossible to definitely demonstrate that software works correctly.
All we can do is demonstrate that with high likelihood software 
implementations work as intended. Whether software testing demonstrates
"high likelihood" depends on the standards and adherence to the standards
of the tester. Describe in lab3.pdf how you would approach demonstrating
that your implementation of 3.1 and 3.2 work correctly. Perform your tests
and discuss the results.
The TAs will complement your tests with their own tests to gauge
correctness.
</p>


<hr width="100%">
<h2>4. Monitoring responsiveness [30 pts]</h2>

<p>
For some processes such as interactive apps, responsiveness is an important
performance criterion. One measure of responsiveness is how long a ready process
has to wait until it executes on a CPU. To measure responsiveness we will add
three new process table fields: uint32 prnumcurrent, uint32 prreadywait, and
uint32 prreadystart. The fields
are initialized to 0 when a process is created. prnumcurrent counts how many times
a process runs on the CPU. prreadywait is the sum of all the delays (in msec) a
process incurs while waiting in XINU's ready list. Hence prreadywait divided by
prnumcurrent is the average response time of a process that awaits execution. To
measure response time, prreadystart is set to interruptcounter when a process
is inserted into the ready list. When a process becomes current, prreadystart is
subtracted from interruptcounter and added to prreadywait. prnumcurrent is
incremented by 1.
</p>

<p>
To support querying response time of a process, implement a new system call, 
syscall responsetime(pid32 pid), in system/responsetime.c that returns prreadywait
divided by prnumcurrent in unit of msec. If pid is invalid or prnumcurrent
is 0, return SYSERR. Test to establish that your code works correctly.
</p>

<hr width="100%">
<h2>5. Dynamic priority scheduling [160 pts]</h2>

<h3>5.1 Objective of process scheduling</h3>

<p>
The default XINU scheduler is a static (or fixed) priority scheduler that uses
priorities specified in the create() system call and never changes them.
XINU's process scheduler, resched(), picks a highest priority ready
process to run next. If there is a tie, round-robin scheduling is implemented
among the group of highest priority processes.
In computing systems where multiple processes share CPU resources, "fair"
allocation of CPU cycles is the default goal. The notion of fairness can
be given different technical meaning. For example, in equal share fairness
with N tasks needing to be scheduled on a shared resource such as a
CPU, every task is expected to receive 1/N, i.e., equal share of CPU time.
This notion of fairness may be used in
scheduling of messages, called packets, on routers which are devices that
packets pass through on their journey from source to destination.
It is used in today's Linux scheduler which was
changed several years ago implement a form of fair scheduling.
UNIX and Windows schedulers -- and the prior Linux scheduler -- 
achieve constant (i.e., O(1)) overhead
as a function of the number of processes in the system.
Today's Linux scheduler, called CFS (completely fair scheduler), incurs 
logarithmic overhead.
</p>

<p>
The main issue with applying fair scheduling to operating system scheduling 
is that processes exhibit diverse traits. For example, many are short-lived whereas
a few are long-lived. Some processes mostly require CPU cycles and do not tend
to block whereas others perform a lot of I/O operations 
that result in blocked system calls.
The former are referred to as CPU-bound processes, the latter are called
I/O-bound.
Enforcing meaningful equal share fairness of CPU usage when
processes are not created at the same time and have different CPU demands
add complications that detract from the simple idea of providing equal share
of CPU cycles.
Since I/O-bound processes, by their nature,
tend to require less CPU time than CPU-bound processes, trying to enforce
equal share leads to complications that are counter to equitable and efficient
sharing of system resources.
</p>

<h3>5.2 Differentiated treatment of CPU- and I/O-bound processes</h3>

<p>
Process scheduling in operating systems is different from general workload scheduling
in that it accounts for the need to provide differentiated treatment of CPU- and I/O-bound 
processes. 
CPU-bound processes require long bouts of CPU cycles.
I/O-bound processes require significantly less CPU time due to blocking,
but when unblocked benefit from fast response time. 
Operating system scheduling aims to
"compensate" I/O-bound processes for being less CPU hungry 
by assigning them higher priority over CPU-bound processes in order to 
enhance responsiveness.
Since many I/O-bound processes, including web browsers and
games are interactive, they benefit from differentiated treatment that balances
the needs of I/O- and CPU-bound processes.
The specific scheduling
algorithms employed by UNIX, Windows, and pre-2007 Linux operating systems
that reward I/O-bound processes with increased responsiveness for not hogging CPU
cycles is varied. In this problem, we will implement a round-robin FIFO scheduler
that prioritizes I/O-bound processes over CPU-bound processes.
We will call it differentiated FIFO (DF) scheduler.
</p>


<h3>5.3 Basic operation of DF scheduler</h3>

<p>
The basic operation of the differentiated FIFO scheduler to be implemented in XINU
is as follows. Two FIFO queues are maintained, one for I/O-bound ready processes,
and another for CPU-bound ready processes. When resched() is invoked, it checks
if the FIFO queue of I/O-bound processes is non-empty. If so, it picks the first
process in the queue to become the new occupant of the CPU. The current process is
context-switched out. If resched() was called by sleepms(), the old process will
sleep. Upon waking up it will be enqueued in the FIFO queue of I/O-bound processes 
since it voluntarily relinquished the CPU by making a blocking system call. 
The old process is enqueued in the FIFO queue of
CPU-bound processes if resched() was called by clkhandler() because the old process
exhausted its time slice (i.e., preempt = 0). That is, it did not voluntarily
give up the CPU but consumed all of its alloted quantum. Whether accurate or not,
we will take this to mean that the recent behavior of the old process resembles that 
of a CPU-bound process. The third case is where resched() was called by 
clkhandler() and the old process has not depleted its time slice. We will enqueue 
the old process in the FIFO queue of I/O-bound processes.
</p>

<p>
When resched() is called and the FIFO queue of I/O-bound processes is empty, then
the FIFO queue of CPU-bound processes is checked. If it is empty, the current process
is given a fresh quantum and allowed to remain current. Outside of the idle process,
it is the only ready process in the system. If the queue is non-empty and the old
process's time slice is not depleted (i.e., preempt &gt; 0) the old process is allowed
to remain current. It does not get a fresh quantum but continues consuming its
partially consumed time slice. If the queue is non-empty and the old process's
time slice is depleted, the next process in the FIFO queue of CPU-bound processes 
is dequeued and made current. The old process is enqueued in the FIFO queue of 
CPU-bound processes. Thus using two FIFO queues, DF scheduling can be implemented
with constant overhead independent of the number of processes in the system.
</p>


<h3>5.4 Implementation of DF scheduler in XINU</h3>

<p>
For backward compatibility with legacy XINU, we will forgo the constant overhead
implementation of DF scheduling but utilize XINU's ready list -- a priority queue --
to implement a linear overhead version. A process that is deemed I/O-bound will
be assigned priority IOPRIO defined in include/process.h as 50. A process that is
classified as CPU-bound is assigned priority CPUPRIO which is defined as 30.
Instead of introducing two FIFO queues, when enqueueing actions are performed
in 5.3 we will insert a process in XINU's ready list using the legacy kernel
function insert(). Hence at any given time, XINU's ready list will have I/O-bound
process of priority IOPRIO at the front followed by CPU-bound processes of
priority CPUPRIO. At the very end will be the idle/NULL process. By the way
insert() is coded when a process to be inserted has the same priority as another
process in the list, XINU ready list will emulate the actions of two FIFO 
queues obeying the rules of 5.3. The cost is that enqueueing overhead is not
constant but linear.
</p>

<p>
A newly created process will be assigned priority CPUPRIO. Hence the third
argument of create() which specifies a process's priority is ignored.
For simplicity, we will use the same QUANTUM (defined in include/kernel.h) for both
CPU- and I/O-bound process, albeit with its value changed from 2 to 40.
The above implementation of DF scheduling in XINU suffers from potential starvation
of CPU-bound processes if the number of I/O-bound processes is too numerous.
That is, even though each I/O-bound process may consume very little CPU time and
block, the number of ready I/O-bound processes may be so many that there is always a
ready I/O-bound process to take the place of an I/O-bound process that is
context-switched out. Similar to UNIX Solaris TS scheduling we may introduce
starvation prevention mechanisms. We will ignore this issue in lab3 and 
not introduce additional mechanisms.
</p>


<h3>5.5 Evaluation of XINU's DF scheduler</h3>

<p>
<b>Test applications.</b>
Code two test applications, void cpuapp(void), that serves as a CPU-bound app and a program,
void ioapp(void), that acts as an I/O-bound app. The code of cpuapp() in system/cpuapp.c
works as follows:
<br><br>
int i = 0, k;
<br>
while(interruptcounter &lt; 5000)    // loop until wall clock time of 5 sec is reached
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i++; 
<br>
k = getpid();
<br>
kprintf("cpuapp: %d %d %d %d\n", k, cpuusage(k), responsetime(k), proctab[k].prnumcurrent);
<br><br>
Since interruptcounter tracks system uptime in unit of millisecond,
cpuapp()
keeps performing ALU operations until 5 seconds have elapsed at which time it prints its
PID, CPU usage, response time, and number of times it ran on the CPU.
</p>

<p>
<i>
Note: The C type qualifier, volatile,
can be used to inform gcc not to engage in register optimization that 
can result in incorrect execution. In the case
of interruptcounter in the for-loop, gcc cannot be expected to not know that x86
asynchronous interrupts through IDT invokes clkdisp which updates interruptcounter. 
To gcc, the for-loop comparison of interruptcounter against 5000 will appear
to always result in the same outcome since the for-loop code does not change the
value of interruptcounter. To optimize for speed, gcc may generate machine code that
performs the comparison only once then uses the outcome for the remaining 4999
iterations. Although well-intentioned this can result in a bug.
To prevent gcc from performing optimizations that can introduce bugs,
we can declare interruptcounter as volatile.
In general, when coding software that deals with asynchronous events,
we need to be vigilant that gcc does no harm.
gcc is but a tool, and it is up to the
programmer to utilize it effectively.
</i>
</p>

<p>
The I/O-bound application, ioapp() in system/ioapp.c, works as follows:
<br><br>
int i = 0, h, k;
<br>
while(interruptcounter &lt; 5000) {   // until wall clock time of 5 sec is reached do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i++; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for(h=0; h &lt; LOOPBOUND; h++) ;   // consume some more CPU cycles before blocking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sleepms(SLEEPTIME);
<br>
}
<br>
k = getpid();
<br>
kprintf("ioapp: %d %d %d %d\n", k, cpuusage(k), responsetime(k), proctab[k].prnumcurrent);
<br><br>
Sleep interval SLEEPTIME and LOOPBOUND should be defined in ioapp.c. They will affect
the degree to which ioapp() will behave in an I/O-bound manner. Set the default value of
SLEEPTIME to 200 and LOOPBOUND to 500000.
We expect CPU usage of ioapp() to be smaller than cpuapp().
Response time of ioapp() should be smaller than cpuapp().
Performance contrast between cpuapp() and ioapp() will depend on parameters
SLEEPTIME and LOOPBOUND. Using the default values as starting point, modify the
values to yield significant performance differences between cpuapp() and ioapp()
processes when testing XINU's DF scheduler.
</p>

<p>
<b>Test scenario A.</b>
Create 3 CPU-bound processes from main()
back-to-back. Assign the process running main() priority 999, and modify
create() so that so that when the third argument is 999 the priority value is
not ignored but set to 999. This hack allows main() to create and resume
child processes before terminating.
If DF scheduler is implemented correctly, we would
expect to see the 3 CPU-bound processes receive similar CPU usage, response time,
and number of times executed on the CPU.. 
Discuss your result in lab3.pdf.
</p>

<p>
<b>Test scenario B.</b>
Create 3 I/O-bound processes from main() and perform the same benchmark tests as
scenario A. The three processes must run the same code with the same parameters
SLEEPTIME and LOOPBOUND.
Discuss your result in lab3.pdf.
</p>

<p>
<b>Test scenario C.</b>
Create 3 CPU-bound processes and 3 I/O-bound processes. We would expect the 3 CPU-bound processes
to output similar CPU usage, response time, and prnumcurrent values
with respect to each other. The same goes for the 3 I/O-bound processes.
Across the two groups, we would expect CPU-bound processes to receive
more CPU time than I/O-bound processes but incur larger response time
than I/O-bound processes.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>


<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
