<h2>3. Inspecting and modifying XINU source, compiling, and 
executing on backend machines (240 pts)</h2>

<p>
Follow the instructions in the
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/xinu/xinu-setup.html">XINU set-up</a>
which compiles the XINU source code on a frontend machine (Linux PC)
in the XINU Lab, grabs an unused x86 Galileo backend machine,
loads and bootstraps the compiled XINU image. Note that a frontend
PC's terminal acts as a remote console of the selected
backend Galileo x86 machine. If XINU bootstraps successfully,
it will print a greeting message and start a simple shell
called xsh. The help command will list the set of commands
supported by xsh. Run some commands on the shell and follow
the disconnect procedure so that the backend is released.
Do not hold onto a backend: it is a shared resource.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.1 (30 pts)</h3>

<p>
Basic system initialization and steps to app creation in XINU.
</p>

<p>
(a)
<i>XINU initialization and idle process.</i>
Inside the system/ subdirectory in xinu-spring2022/, you will find the bulk of relevant
XINU source code. The file start.S contains AT&amp;T assembly code
that is executed after XINU bootstraps on a backend using the Xboot bootloader. Some
system initialization is performed by Xboot, but most OS related hardware and software
initialization is carried out by start.S and other XINU code in system/ after Xboot jumps 
to start in start.S. Eventually, start.S calls nulluser(), contained in
initialize.c, which continues the bulk of kernel initialization.
nulluser() calls
sysinit() (also in initialize.c) 
where updates to the data structure proctab[] are made which
represents XINU's process table. In XINU, as well as in Linux/UNIX
and Windows, a process table is one of the key data structures
of an operating system where bookkeeping of all created
processes is done. In our Galileo x86 backend which has
a single CPU (or core), only one process can occupy the CPU at a time.
In a x86 machine with 4 CPUs (i.e.,
quad-core) up to 4 processes may be running concurrently.
Most of XINU's kernel code can be found in system/ (.c and .S files) and include/ (.h header files).
At this time, we will use the terms "process" and "thread" interchangeably.
Their technical difference will be considered when discussing process
management.
</p>

<p>
When a backend machine bootstraps and performs initialization,
there is as yet no notion of a "process." That is, the hardware
just executes a sequence of machine instructions compiled by
gcc and statically linked on a frontend Linux PC for our target backend x86 CPU (i.e.,
the binary xinu.xbin). This
includes machine code translated from initialize.c. nulluser()
in initialize.c calls sysinit() which
sets up the process table data structure proctab[] which keeps
track of relevant information about created processes that have
not terminated. When a process terminates, its entry is removed
from proctab[]. After configuring proctab[] to
hold up to NPROC processes (a system constant defined
in config/), sysinit() creates the first process,
called the NULL or idle process. This idle process exists
not only in XINU but also in Linux/UNIX and Windows. It is the
ancestor of all other processes in the system in the sense that
all other processes are created by this special NULL process
and its descendants through system call create().
The NULL process is the only process that is not created by system call
create() but instead "handcrafted" during system initialization.
Determine in which kernel function the process table data structure,
proctab[], is initialized. Determine how many processes can exist
in XINU. To do so, search for NPROC in config/ and include/.
The former includes XINU configuration files that are used by
compiler tools to generate C code that is then compiled with
code in system/. The latter contains the header files of XINU.
Determine where (i.e., which lines in which code) the NULL process
is handcrafted without calling create(). 
Determine what values are assigned as its priority,
process state, and process ID (PID). 
</p>

<p>
(b)
<i>Role of XINU's main and removing xsh.</i>
After nulluser() sets up the first process, it spawns
a child process using system call create() which runs the C code
startup(). Upon inspecting startup(), you will find that
all it does is create a child process to run function main() in
main.c. 
We will use the child process that executes main() in
main.c as the test app for gauging the impact of kernel modifications
on application behavior. In the code of main() in main.c,
a "Hello World" message is printed after which a child process that runs
another app, xsh, is spawned which outputs a prompt "xsh $ "
and waits for user command. We will not be using
xsh since it is but another app and not relevant for
understanding operating systems.
Remove the "Hello World" message from main() and put it in
a separate function, void mygreeting(void), in system/mygreeting.c.
Call mygreeting() from nulluser() before it creates the idle process.
Customize the "Hello World" message so that it contains your name and
username. Modify main() so that it is completely empty but for a message
that says "Process running main():" followed by the PID of process.
To do so, inspect the files in system/ to find a XINU system call that returns
the PID of the current process.
The modifications of (b)
will carry over to all subsequent lab assignments.
</p>

<p>
For new functions that are added to XINU, insert its function prototype in 
include/prototypes.h.
The header file prototypes.h is included in the aggregate header file xinu.h.
Every time you make a change to XINU, be it operating system code
or app code, you need to recompile XINU on a frontend Linux machine and
load a backend with the new xinu.xbin binary.
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.2 (60 pts)</h3>

<p>
We will create our first system call, a variant of create(), mcreate(), which has the
same function prototype as create() but incorporates minor modifications. 
</p>

<p>
(a)
mcreate()  allows a process
to take on a default process priority if the priority value in mcreate() is specified as -1.
If so, the priority of the child process (i.e., process created using mcreate())
is initialized as the priority of the parent process plus 1.
Determine the range of priority values that a process can take on in XINU by checking its type. If
adding 1 were to exceed the range, mycreate() returns SYSERR and process creation fails.
If mcreate() is followed by resume(), this has the effect of running the child process
before its parent.
</p>

<p>
(b)
We will disallow negative priority values but for -1. If a value less than -1 is
passed in mcreate(), it returns SYSERR. Search for the process table priority field,
prprio, in the code in system/ and determine if there may be a side effect to
legacy code by imposing the non-negativity restriction. Provide your answer in lab1.pdf.
</p>

<p>
(c)
We will track how many processes that a process has created are still alive
(i.e., have not terminated). To do so, introduce a new process table field,
uint16 prnumchildren, that is initialized to 0 when a process is created. In the
parent process's process table entry increment prnumchildren. 
We will place a limit on the number of active
(i.e., still alive) child processes a process can have to NUMCHILDREN. Use #define
to set the value to 15 in include/process.h. mcreate() checks if creating a new
child would exceed NUMCHILDREN and, if so, returns SYSERR.
</p>

<p>
(d) To support the third modification we need to modify the system call kill()
which is called when terminating a process.
kill() calls send() to inform the parent that its child has terminated. Note that
calling send() to inform the parent, prptr-&gt;prparent, where prptr is a pointer to
the current process's process table entry, is buggy since the parent process may
have terminated and its PID allocated to another process.
In Linux orphaned processes are handled by having a special process, process
with PID 1, adopt the orphan. In our case, we will introduce a new process state,
PR_CASPER, defined as 11 in include/process.h. When a process is about to be
terminated, kill() checks prnumchildren to determine if there are active children.
If not, normal termination proceeds. If there are active children, the
process's state is set to PR_CASPER and kill() returns SYSERR.
In addition to checking whether a terminating process has active children,
we need to check if its parent is in state PR_CASPER. If so, the parent's
process table field prnumchildren is decremented, and if the resultant value is
0 the parent is terminated by calling kill().
To solve (d), it helps to go over Problem 3.3 first which considers the
steps that a process follows when it terminates upon executing the last ret
instruction.
</p>

<p>
Place mcreate() in system/mcreate.c and perform tests to evaluate correctness. For example,
call mcreate() passing -1 as the child's priority value and verify that upon readying the
child by calling resume() the child executes before the parent.
In the case of orphaned processes, have a parent spawn two child process and call kill()
to terminate itself. This should put the parent into state PR_CASPER. Only after both
child processes have terminated should the parent process be terminated and removed
from the process table proctab[]. Discuss in lab1.pdf your methods for testing
correctness of the four modifications. Note that much of software development, and
that applies to kernel coding, revolves around testing for correctness and performance
after basic coding that compiles is complete. Testing is a skill that is acquired through
practice and involves significant effort.
Make sure to pay attention to quality control.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.3 (20 pts)</h3>

<p>
In 3.2(d) we discuss a process terminating by calling kill() with the process's PID as
argument. When a process is created by calling create() and the first argument, a
function pointer, points to a function whose last statement is "return" (i.e., ret
in assembly language) where does the function return to? Find the answer by looking
at the code of create() and how the stack of the process created to execute the
code pointed to by the function pointer is configured. After tracking down where
the function returns to, determine what happens next. How is this related to
explicitly terminating a process by calling kill()? Describe your answer in lab1.pdf.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.4 (20 pts)</h3>

<p>
Some system parameters of XINU are configured in config/Configuration
which contains meta data from which C code (conf.c and conf.h in config/) is
produced using automated translation tools. 
These parsing and lexical analysis tools covered in a compiler course will not concern us as they
are useful but not necessary for understanding and coding
XINU.
The IRQBASE constant 32 in config/Configuration results in its
inclusion as a C preprocessor directive in config/conf.h. IRQBASE
defines the component of the x86 interrupt vector to
which clock interrupts
are mapped to. Recall from computer architecture that the interrupt
vector serves as an interface between hardware and software so that when an
interrupt occurs it is routed to the responsible software component for
handling it. That is, the interrupt
handling code of an operating system that is tasked with responding
to the interrupt.
The clock interrupt in our x86 Galileo backends is configured to go off 
every 1 millisecond (msec), i.e., 1000 clock interrupts per second.
Several years back a popular configuration was 10 msec.
x86 supports 256 interrupts numbered 0, 1, ..., 255 of which the first
32, called exceptions (or faults), are reserved for dedicated purposes.
XINU chooses to configure clock interrupts at interrupt number 32.
</p>

<p>
When a clock interrupt is generated, it is routed through interrupt
number 32 to XINU's kernel code clkdisp.S in system/ which, in turn, calls clkhandler()
in system/clkhandler.c
to carry out relevant tasks.
Modify clkhandler() in clkhandler.c so that a global variable, int msclkcounter, declared
and initialized to 0 in clkinit.c, is incremented when clkhandler() is called.
Test that msclkcounter is being updated correctly by XINU's clock interrupt handling code
by making main() sleep for 3 seconds by calling sleep(), then printing the value of
msclkcounter. Declare a second global variable, int msclkcounter2, in clkinit.c initialized
to 0, that is incremented in the clkdisp.S after the call to clkhandler() returns.
Test using sleep() that msclkcounter2 is being correctly updated by XINU's interrupt
handling system. Discuss in lab1.pdf your findings and accuracy of the testing method
using sleep().
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.5 (30 pts)</h3>

<p>
After nulluser() handcrafts the first process and spawns a child process
running the code of main(),
nulluser() enters into an infinite while loop, hence does not terminate.
The purpose of the idle or NULL process in XINU -- the same holds for
Linux/UNIX and Windows -- is so that there is always a process to run
on a CPU when no other processes require CPU cycles.
It may be that all other processes are sleeping, suspended, or waiting for events such as
a response from a server.
When an interrupt occurs XINU temporarily ceases
running the code of the process executing on Galileo's x86 CPU. With the help
of x86's interrupt vector jumps to its
clock interrupt handling code, then returns to the code that was interrupted
to resume where it left off. We adopt the view that the interrupt handling code
has been executed by the process whose own code was temporarily put on hold. 
We say that the interrupt handling code was executed by borrowing the context, or
state, of the current process occupying the CPU. 
Thus except during bootloading before the first process is created, all code
executed on a CPU is viewed as being carried out by some process. This
includes even interrupt
handling code that may have nothing to do with the currently running process
on a CPU.
To enforce this abstraction,
we need an idle or NULL process that is always ready to run on the CPU in case
no other processes require CPU cycles. That is, there is no ready process but
the idle process.
</p>

<p>
In mobile devices, conserving battery power is important, 
hence a different strategy is needed than to just execute
an infinite while loop in the idle process which expends energy. 
In server farms powered
by electrical grid, an important concern is cooling to dissipate
heat generated by machines in confined spaces. 
A CPU that executes instructions consumes energy and generates heat.
We will implement an energy consumption reduction method by putting
the CPU in a halted state using the x86 hlt assembly instruction. The hlt instruction
puts the CPU in a hibernating state until an external interrupt occurs. On our backends,
this will likely be a clock interrupt which wakes up the CPU so that the interrupt can
be serviced. 
To prevent XINU's NULL
process from continually executing unconditional jumps (which is what an
infinite while loop with an empty body does) when it occupies the CPU, we 
add x86's hlt instruction to the body of the while loop. Until an interrupt occurs,
the NULL process puts Galileo's CPU into hibernation which reduces energy
consumption and heat generation.
</p>

<p>
(a)
One way to accomplish this energy saving modification 
is to code an assembly function, myhalt in system/myhalt.S, that executes hlt followed
by ret, which is called from the body of the infinite while loop of C function nulluser(). 
Hence nulluser() coded in C calls myhalt coded in AT&amp;T assembly language.
Code myhalt.S, modify nulluser() to call myhalt, then repeat the msclkcounter2 test
of Problem 3.4 to check that the modified kernel continues to work correctly.
Discuss your results in lab1.pdf.
</p>

<p>
(b)
Function calls
entail caller/callee coordination which incurs overhead through additional instruction execution
which is what we are aiming to reduce. A more efficient method that does not entail
calling a function embeds the assembly
instruction hlt within the C code of nulluser() using in-line assembly. By
adding the statement asm("hlt") to the body of nulluser()'s infinite while loop,
we instruct the C compiler gcc to insert the hlt instruction when translating
the C code into assembly. There is no need for a function call.
Modify the code of
nulluser() to utilize in-line assembly to execute hlt inside the infinite
while loop. 
Perform the same test as (a) and discuss your results.
Submit initialize.c that contains nulluser() which implements (a) to execute hlt, 
not (b). When testing (b), comment out the call to myhalt() of (a) and insert
asm("hlt").
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.6 (20 pts)</h3>

<p>
When multiple processes wanting to run on a shared CPU compete, XINU determines who
gets to run based on their priority values. The same principle applies to Linux/UNIX
and Windows. The component of an operating system that decides who gets to run next
is called the scheduler. In XINU the larger the priority value of a process, 
the more important it is, and the scheduler allocates Galileo's x86 CPU to a
process that has highest priority. We cannot say "the" process since two or more
processes may have equal and highest priority.
In the case of a tie, XINU performs round-robin scheduling which
means running one process for a while, then switching to another of equal
and highest priority, and so forth, until coming back to the first
highest priority process. Then the procedure repeats itself. The time
spent running a process before switching to another is called time slice or
quantum. It is given by system constant QUANTUM in XINU which is defined in
include/kernel.h. Increase its value from 2 to 40 msec.
Should the change of time slice affect the test results of Problem 3.4?
Explain your reasoning in lab1.pdf.
</p>

<p>
In order to assure that the NULL process only runs if there are no other processes
wanting to run -- i.e., there are no other ready processes -- we must assign the 
NULL process the lowest priority and there can be no tie.
Having looked at initialize.c where the NULL process is handcrafted and modified
the code of create() into mcreate(), determine if mcreate() guarantees that no
process created has priority equal to that of the NULL process. If this is not
the case, implement a fix and describe what you have done in lab1.pdf.
System call, chprio(), allows the priority of an existing process to be changed.
Check if chprio() ensures that the NULL process is guaranteed to have 
lowest priority. If not, implement a fix and annotate the code chprio() to
note what change has been made.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.7 (20 pts)</h3>

<p>
As we have already seen with the hlt instruction in Problem 3.5,
some aspects of operating system code cannot be implemented in C but require assembly 
coding to make the hardware do what we want. 
It is by necessity, not choice. We saw an example in Problem 3.4.
We will practice coding a function in
assembly so that it can be called from a function coded in C. This is mainly an 
exercise in checking that you understand how the CDECL caller/callee convention for our
32-bit x86 Galileo backends works.
You will pick up basics of AT&amp;T assembly coding on x86 CPUs. This is useful
but secondary to understanding how to interface functions at the machine code level, called
ABI (application binary interface) programming.
</p>

<p>
You are given a function
addtwo() of function prototype, int addtwo(int x, int y), coded in AT&amp;T
assembly in addtwo.S in the course directory. Copy the file into your system/
directory and update include/prototypes.h. 
Call it from main() and verify that it works correctly.
Use addtwo.S as a starting point to code a function, maxthree() of
function prototype, int maxthree(int x, int y, int z), coded in AT&amp;T
assembly in system/maxthree.S that returns the maximum of the three integer
values passed. Annotate maxthree.S with comments, and add your name and username
at the beginning of the file.
Use your understanding of CDECL on 32-bit x86 Galileo machines which we reviewed
and looking up basic AT&amp;T assembly instructions (confer 
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/manuals.html">reference material</a>).
Assembly code can vary between different hardware and software platforms.
However, the logic behind ABI coding remains invariant.
It is this understanding that is important to acquire. Of course, you will
be asked to put the understanding to work by implementing working code in
our specific system environment.
This is an exercise to help you prepare for kernel coding in lab2
and beyond.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.8 (40 pts)</h3>

<p>
We will do a role reversal of Problem 3.7 where instead of calling a function coded in assembly
from a function coded in C, we will call a function coded in C from a function
coded in assembly. You will perform the chores of the caller following CDECL when
writing assembly code, keeping in mind that the callee's C code, named 
int maxthreeC(int x, int y, int z), in system/maxthreeC.c to distinguish from its
assembly counterpart, will be translated by gcc into assembly following CDECL.
For testing purposes, code an assembly function, int testmaxthree(void), 
in system/testmaxthree.S
which will be called from main(). testmaxthree in testmaxthree.S will then call C function,
int maxthreeC(int x, int y, int z) which returns
the maximum value. 
Hardcode the three arguments passed by testmaxthree() to maxthreeC() so that their values
are 3, 1, and 5. Since gcc is responsible for translating maxthreeC.c and you are responsible for
caller code testmaxthree.S, you will need to push the three
arguments (in the right-to-left order dictated by CDECL) onto the stack, 
followed by the return address before triggering a jump
to maxthreeC(). The last two steps are performed
by assembly instruction call.
After maxthreeC() returns the result in EAX, you will need to preserve
it which is tantamount to returning the value to main() so that main() can
output its value by calling kprintf(). Hence the complete picture is that
main() coded in C calls testmaxthree() coded in assembly which, in turn, calls
maxthreeC() coded in C. If ABI programming is correctly implemented,
interfacing between main() and testmaxthree(), and testmaxthree() and maxthreeC(), will
work seamlessly.
</p>

<h2><b>Bonus problem</b> (20 pts)</h2>

<p>
As a variation of Problem 3.2, implement a modified version of mcreate(), m2create(),
with the same function prototype that instead of putting a newly created process in
suspended state puts it in ready state. Examine the code of resume() which calls ready()
to ready a suspended process. Note that ready performs three tasks: change process
state to ready, insert the readied process into a priority queue of ready processes
waiting to run on the CPU, and calls XINU scheduler resched() to give it a chance
to decide which process to run next. Describe your solution in lab1.pdf and test that
it works correctly.
</p>

<p>
<i>
Note: The bonus problem provides an opportunity to earn extra credits that
count toward the lab component of the course. It is intended to help reach the
maximum contribution of the lab component (45%) more easily. It is purely optional.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>

<p>
If you are unsure what you need to submit in what format, consult the
