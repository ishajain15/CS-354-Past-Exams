<h2>Lab 4: Blocking Send, Deadlock Detection, and 
Run-time Modification of Process Behavior (320 pts)</h2>
</center>
<center>
<h2>Due: 03/30/2022 (Wed.), 11:59 PM</h2>
</center>
<h2>1. Objectives</h2>
The objectives of this lab are, one, to enhance XINU's IPC services by adding
system call support for timed send(), two, provide deadlock detection service for
semaphore system calls, and
three, use ROP programming techniques to modify
process behavior from a hacker's perspective.
ROP techniques will be used in lab5 to support asynchronous IPC with callback
function support.

<h2>3. Blocking message send with timeout [120 pts]</h2>

<p>
This problem concerns the implementation
of a blocking version of <em>send</em>(), call it <em>sendblk</em>().
sendblk() follows the same function definition as send()
but has an additional argument that allows for timed
blocking similar to recvtime(). The additional argument, tlimit, is of type
int32 and specifies in unit of seconds how long a process may block before
it returns.  If tlimit is -1, sendblk() blocks indefinitely.
If its value is 0, then sendblk() overwrites the receiver's
message buffer with its message and returns.
</p>

<p>
Thus, if the receiver's 1-word message buffer is empty, sendblk() behaves
like send(). If the receiver's buffer is full, sendblk() does not block if
tlimit is 0 but blocks if tlimit is positive or -1, i.e., the kernel context switches
out the calling process
and puts it into a waiting state. This is implemented
by defining an additional constant PR_SNDBLK (choose
an appropriate value to assign) in process.h. The 1-word message that makes
the calling process block is stored in the sending process's
process table entry by defining two additional fields:
<br><br>
umsg32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sndblkmsg;
<br>
uint16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sndstatus;
<br><br>
where sndblkmsg holds the 1-word message and sndstatus is nonzero if
sndblkmsg is valid. In addition, if tlimit is positive, the sending process
is inserted in the sleep queue to be woken up after tlimit timer.
If the receiver buffer eventually clears and the
blocked process succeeds in sending a message before the tlimit
sleep expires, the process must be removed from the sleep queue. 
Use unsleep() to
remove a sleeping process from the sleep queue.
If tlimit elapses before sending succeeds, the timed
blocking process is dequeued and readied by the clock interrupt handler.
sendblk() should return MAXBLKEX (assign a meaningful value)
to indicate that sending has failed due
to timeout.
</p>

<p>
All the sending processes that are inserted into the sleep queue are also inserted
into a separate FIFO queue that contains sending processes blocking to send to
a common receiver. The FIFO queue is implemented by adding fields in the process
table entry of the receiver process that specify the FIFO queue and whether the
queue is empty. Define your own field types and data structures for this purpose. 
Describe their meaning in lab4.pdf.
If tlimit is -1, i.e., the sending process may wait
indefinitely without timeout, it is inserted into the FIFO queue only.
That is, the sleep queue does not need to be updated.
</p>

<p>
On the receiver side, before a receiving process returns from
receive() it must check if there are any blocked sending processes,
and if so, unblock one of the waiting processes from its FIFO queue.
If the unblocked (i.e., readied) process had performed a timed sendblk(),
then it must also be removed from the sleep queue.
In lab4.pdf, discuss the overhead of sendblk() and the revised
receive(). Introducing sendblk() entails changes to several parts of
legacy XINU. List all the legacy code that needed to
be modified, new code that needed to be introduced and their synopsis 
in a text file README under lab4/. That includes
changes to header files. When patching a kernel, specification of
the changes is the first step in identifying dependencies that must be
resolved to achieve a correct kernel binary.
</p>

<p>
Create test
cases whose output (e.g., senders may print sender-specific 1-word
messages before calling sendblk() and a receiver may
print a received message) demonstrate the correct functioning
of the blocking message send extension of kernel services.
In the case of timed send, print the current time in millisecond (use the
millisecond counter interruptcounter from lab3) before calling sendblk() and the time
after sendblk() returns, along with the process ID. In the case
of non-timed send with indefinite blocking, make the receiver sluggish
(i.e., it sleeps a lot) so that its FIFO sender queue builds up.
The sequence of printouts to console should show the correct functioning
of the blocking send kernel extension. The most complicated test
case is one with timed blocking send where in some instances
timers expire, in others sending succeeds. Careful crafting of
the test cases is required to verify for yourself that your revised
kernel is working correctly, in addition to demonstrating to
others. In lab4.pdf describe how you set up your test
cases and their rationale.

<h2>4. Deadlock detection extension of semaphores [120 pts]</h2>
<p>
As discussed in class, deadlock detection is
an overhead-prone service, and given its limited impact on
the system as a whole (assuming isolation/protection is
implemented),
a kernel may choose not to provide deadlock
related services as part of its system call suite.
In this problem, you are asked to extend the semaphore services exported
by XINU such that deadlock detection -- when so desired
by a user process -- is provided.
There are different approaches for implementing deadlock
detection. The specific approach we will follow
defines a sibling system call of <em>wait</em>(), call it
<em>waitdlk</em>(), which checks if waiting on a semaphore
would result in a cycle in the semaphore resource
graph which XINU maintains.
If not, the resultant blocking action is the same as
wait(). On the other hand, if a cycle were to result,
waitdlk() returns to the
calling process without blocking
with error status -2. Define it as SYSERR_DLK in
the same header file where SYSERR is defined. By checking
the return value of waitdlk(), a
process is alerted of the impending deadlock. What action the
process subsequently takes is up to the app programmer.
The system call <em>signal</em>() also gets a sibling, <em>signaldlk</em>().
</p>

<p>
Since waitdlk(), as with wait(), executes its
code after disabling interrupts, the overhead incurred by
linear time deadlock detection is a key concern.
Describe in lab4.pdf how you go about performing
deadlock detection. Define your own data structures for
implementing the semaphore resource graph and specify them
in dlk.h under include/. As noted in class, we have not
covered memory management hence you may not use dynamic
memory allocation primitives (getmem() in XINU) to
implement the resource graph. Instead, use static allocation
(e.g., defining additional process table entries) to
implement a resource graph.
A process is put in a
semaphore queue in PR_WAITING state when it blocks due
to waitdlk(). When that happens, the semaphore resource graph is updated
to reflect the change. If a process is released from
PR_WAITING state by signaldlk(), the semaphore resource graph
is updated accordingly. When signaldlk() is called that
changes a process from PR_WAITING to PR_READY state and dequeues
it from a semaphore queue, the
semaphore resource graph must be updated as well.
Deadlock detection is not guaranteed
if a programmer uses both wait() and waitdlk() (or signal() and signaldlk()) system
calls in the same app code.
</p>
<p>
Evaluate your kernel extension
with three test cases, starting with a 2-process/2-semaphore
deadlock scenario under the default XINU scheduler.
Note that inducing
deadlock, in itself, requires some effort, hence the critical section code
serves to induce deadlocks.
In the second test case, extend to three processes and three semaphores.
Create a third test case and describe its set-up and rationale in lab4.pdf.
A default action by a programmer using waitdlk() that returns SYSERR_DLK is to
terminate the application.
Are there other actions that a programmer may undertake with
the help of waitdlk() that are less drastic? Note that sleeping a while
and then attempting waitdlk() again, in general, will not help.
Discuss your thoughts in lab4.pdf.

<h2>5. Modifying process run-time behavior via ROP and context manipulation [80 pts]</h2>

<p>
An important technique for modifying the run-time behavior of a process is ROP (return-oriented
programming) based process context manipulation where
return addresses in a process's run-time stack are changed to affect its control flow. The
technique can be used for good and bad. In the latter, a hacker may find ways to change
a return address in a stack/buffer overflow attack (also called stack
smashing) which has been the single biggest security exploit 
for compromising computing systems. 
We will consider a surgical version of this technique in XINU that allows an attacker process
to "hijack" the context of a victim process.
</p>

<h3>5.1 Overt attacker</h3>

<p>
Spawn two app processes from main() back-to-back using create()/resume(), 
one running codeV() ("victim") in codeV.c and the other running codeA() ("attacker")
in codeA.c. 
Use the legacy scheduler of XINU and
assign priority 35 to codeV() and priority 25 to codeA().
The code of codeV(), void codeV(void), outputs "codeV: pt1\n" by calling kprintf(),
then calls sleepms() to sleep for 400 msec, and then prints "codeV: pt2\n" before terminating.
</p>

<p>
The process running codeA() is an attacker that aims to hijack the process executing
codeV() by borrowing its context. The attacker possesses specialized knowledge such as knowing
that it will get a chance to run
when codeV() calls sleepms(). When the victim process
running codeV() is context-switched out, its stack will contain the stack frames of
sleepms(), resched(), and ctxsw(). codeA()'s goal, when it is context-switched in,
is to modify the return address (EIP) of ctxsw() -- following CDECL EIP was pushed at the boundary
of the stack frames of resched() (caller) and ctxsw() (callee) --
in the stack of the context-switched out victim process.
The attacker, if he/she knows how to find the return address of ctxsw() in the stack of the victim
process, surgically modifies the return address so that when the
victim process is context-switched in
after sleeping for 400 msec it will not return to resched() but jump to code belonging to
the attacker, malwareA() in malware.c. That is, malwareA() which was not called by the victim process
nor the attacker process, will run in the context of the victim process
with ESP pointing to the stack frame of resched()
as if malwareA() -- not resched() -- had called ctxsw().
Although in XINU we do not implement user mode/kernel mode
separation, if the attack had been successfully carried out in Linux/Windows it would have allowed
the attacker to run his/her code malwareA() in kernel mode since the victim has yet
to return to user code.
</p>

<p>
The attacker's "malware" function, void malwareA(void), outputs "codeA\n" by calling kprintf().
When the victim process wakes up from sleep and outputs "codeA\n" we know that the attacker
has been successful in hijacking the victim process.
That is, the attacker has successfully
induced the victim process to execute code that is not part of the victim's code.
If malwareA() were to call kill() to terminate the victim process after printing "codeA\n",
the remainder of codeV() which prints 
"codeV: pt2\n" would not be executed.
Create subdirectory v1/ under lab4/ and place the victim, attacker code, and main.c in v1/.
</p>

<h3>5.2 Clandestine attacker</h3>

<p>
The attack in 5.1 would have successfully borrowed the context of the victim process, however,
by terminating the victim process without executing the remainder 
of the victim's code (i.e., return from sleepms() which prints "codeV: pt2\n")
the fact that an attack had taken place would have been easily detectable.
A more clandestine attacker would seek to hide his/her tracks by printing "codeA\n" (of course,
in an actual clandestine attack the attacker does not announce itself on the console)
and returning from malwareA() back to the next instruction in codeV()
following the call to sleepms(). 
Hence the victim process, except for the brief interlude
during which its context was intercepted by the attacker, executes normally and remains
oblivious to the attack.
</p>

<p>
Implement the ROP stack attack by coding main(), codeV(), codeA(), and malwareA() and placing
them in separate files following our usual convention in system/.
codeA() and malwareA() should be written in C using extended inline assembly.
Explain in lab4.pdf how you go about accomplishing the goals of 5.1 and 5.2.
When testing your code, first run it without activating the return address manipulation
by codeA() so that everything proceeds normally. Then activate codeA() to
play the role of a hacker, first by terminating the victim after
printing "codeA\n" (5.1), and then returning from malwareA() so that the victim
is oblivious to the attack and prints "codeV: pt2\n" (5.2).
Create subdirectory v2/ under lab4/ and place the victim, attacker code, and main.c in v2/.
</p>


<h2><b>Bonus problem</b> [20 pts]</h2>

<p>
In Problem 5.2 we modified the return address of ctxsw() to effect a detour to
malware code, malwareA(), before resuming execution of the victim code, codeV().
In the specific test scenario where codeV() calls sleepms(), an attacker may
choose to modify the return address of resched() or that of sleepms() to borrow
the context of the victim process to run malware code before jumping back to
codeV() and continue after the call to sleepms(). Describe how you would go
about finding the return address of resched() or sleepms() in the victim 
process's stack to modify. From a hacker's perspective, discuss the pros/cons
of modifying the return address of ctxsw(), resched(), or sleepms().
Submit your answer in lab4.pdf.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>

<p>
If you are unsure what you need to submit in what format, consult the
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hill341/ta-notes.html">TA notes</a> link.
If it doesn't answer your question, ask during PSOs and office hours which are
scheduled M-F.
</p>

<p>
Specific instructions:
</p>

<p>
1. Format for submitting written lab answers and kprintf() added for 
testing and debugging purposes in kernel code:
</p><ul>
<li>
Provide your answers to the questions below in lab4.pdf and
place the file in lab4/. You may use any document editing software
but your final output must be exported and submitted as a pdf file.
</li>
<li>
For problems where you are asked to print values using kprintf(), use
conditional compilation (C preprocessor directives #define combined with #if and #endif)
with macro XINUTEST (in include/process.h) to effect
print/no print depending on if
XINUTEST is defined or not. For your debug statements, do the same with macro XINUDEBUG.
</li>
</ul>
