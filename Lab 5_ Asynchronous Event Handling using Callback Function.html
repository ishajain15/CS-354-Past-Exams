<h2>3. Asynchronous event handling  using callback functions (230 pts)</h2>

<h3>3.1 Overview</h3>

<p>
This problem concerns implementation of asynchronous event handling using 
callback functions in XINU which is provided in modern operating systems including
Linux and Windows. One instance is asynchronous IPC using callback function
which we discussed under inter-process communication. More generally,
asynchronous I/O (i.e., IPC is one form of I/O) entails the programmer
informing a kernel that when a future I/O event such as the receipt of
a packet from a server on a network interface arises the kernel should
run user code -- a callback function -- whose function pointer is
conveyed to the kernel. This step is referred to as registering a callback
function to respond to an event. Other common events include alarms
needed to implement timer functions in app code, catching faults (e.g.,
segmentation fault), responding to child process termination, among
others.
</p>

<p>
As discussed in class, the chief issue when implementing asynchronous
IPC support is the kernel
executing the user's callback function in the context of the process
that registered in user mode.
For example, when a sender process transmits a message to a receiver
proess, the sender process executes a system call in the upper half of
the kernel in kernel mode. The receiver process may have been
context-switched out because it depleted its time slice, performed
a blocking system call, or was preempted by another process of higher
priority when it became ready. When the receiver process
becomes current in the future, the kernel must not allow the
receiver process to continue where it left off but induce a detour
to the receiver process's callback function in user mode. This
ensures isolation/protection is preserved.
The same holds for other event types such as when an alarm expires.
The kernel's lower half detects expiration of an alarm. The process
that registered the alarm could be the current process, or may have
been context-switched out prior. Whatever the case, when the
process that registered a callback function for an alarm becomes
current and resumes executing, the kernel must enforce a detour
to the process's callback function in user mode.
In Linux/MacOS and Windows such events are referred to as 
signals. Callback functions are also referred to as signal handlers.
We will use the terms interchangeably in this problem.
</p>


<h3>3.2 Three event types</h3>

<p>
In this problem we will support three event types: 
<br><br>
<i>SIGCHLD</i>. When a process
terminates, its parent is "notified" in the sense that if the parent
registered a callback function for event SIGCHLD the callback function is 
executed. The parent process may not have registered a signal handler
for SIGCHLD or may have already terminated. Although we considered orphaned
processes in lab1, in legacy XINU orphaned processes are not adopted.
When there is no callback function to run or the parent has already terminated,
the kernel ignores the SIGCHLD event by not taking further action.
Note that in our uniprocessor
Galileo backends, a child process terminating and thus raising the
SIGCHLD signal implies that the parent process is not current.
In multicore system this simplification need not hold.
</p>

<p>
<i>SIGIPC</i>. When a process sends a 1-word message to another process using
send(), the kernel checks if the receiver process registered a callback
function for event SIGIPC. If so, the receiver's callback function is
executed when the receiver process becomes current. As with SIGCHLD, on
Galileo backends a sender process calling send() implies that the
receiver process has been context-switched out.
</p>

<p>
<i>SIGZERO</i>. 
We will support signal SIGZERO which is raised when the current process executes an instruction
that divides by zero triggering exception 0 from Problem 3.2 in lab2.
By supporting SIGZERO, we provide app programmers with the ability to
catch the signal and respond as the programmer sees fit.
Unlike events SIGCHLD and SIGIPC, SIGZERO is synchronous in the sense that
an instruction executed by the current process triggers the event. This
affords a simplification since we do not have to wait until the process that
registered a callback function becomes current before implementing a detour.
</p>

<p>
Define the three events in include/mysignal.h as
</p><pre>#define SIGCHLD 9
#define SIGIPC 10
#define SIGZERO 11
</pre>
<p></p>


<h3>3.3 Callback function registration</h3>

<p>
A process registers a callback function using a new system call
</p><pre>syscall sigregister(uint16 evtype, int32 (* func)(void))
</pre>
in system/sigregister.c
the first argument evtype specifies the event type and
the second argument func specifies the callback function.
sigregister() returns SYSERR if evtype is undefined and/or
the function pointer func falls outside the memory region
of XINU code. For the latter, check initialize.c which uses two global
variables to output the size of XINU code. This enforces that
function pointers must point to the text region of XINU's image
in main memory. sigregister() returns OK if registration succeeds.
If a process calls sigregister() multiple times for the same
event, the last call determines the valid function pointer
(i.e., overwrites the previous function pointer). 
<p></p>

<p>
Introduce additional process table fields to note if a process
has registered callback functions for SIGCHLD, SIGIPC, SIGZERO,
and fields for their respective function pointers. Describe in
lab5.pdf the names, types, and roles of any additional fields
that you have added when implementing Problem 3. Also, add
a process table field, pid32 prchldpid, where the PID of the
child process when SIGCHLD is raised is stored. Note that
multiple child processes may terminate before their common
parent becomes current and the kernel arranges a detour to
the parent's SIGCHLD signal handler. The field prchldpid
stores the PID of the last process that has terminated.
</p>


<h3>3.4 Callback function usage by app programmer</h3>

<p>
What the callback function does is up to the app programmer. A typical example
using app code main() for SIGIPC is
</p><pre>// In main.c.
int main() {
   // Part of app initialization.
   if (sigregister(SIGIPC, &amp;myhandler) == SYSERR) {
      kprintf("SIGIPC registration failed");
      return 1;
   }
   // App code: does not call receive().
   while(1);
}

// In myhandler.c.
int myhandler() {
   // mybuf is global variable
   mybuf = receive();
   // receive() will not block since SIGIPC event has occurred.
   // More app code may follow to respond to received message.
}
</pre>
For debugging and testing purposes, use app code with kprintf() in both
app and kernel code. In general, concurrent client/server apps which comprise
a large segment of real-world apps follow the above structure where
the infinite while-loop in main() contains application specific code.
The application code does not call the callback function myhandler().
For example,
in a web browser (client) the while-loop is replaced by code that accepts
user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse movement), refreshes the GUI, and transmits
requests to web servers. Responses from web servers are handled
asynchronously.
<p></p>


<h3>3.5 Callback function execution in user context</h3>

<p>
<b>Case (i): system calls</b>
Since callback functions are user code they must be executed in user mode in
the context of the processes that registered them. In lab2 we implemented
trapped version of XINU system calls where synchronous interrupt int caused
a trap to kernel code and instruction iret executed by the system call
dispatcher untrapped by returning to user code. Linux and Windows additionally
implement changing privilege levels (user mode and kernel mode) and
switching stacks when trapping to kernel mode. For system calls the point
where a detour to a callback function may be effected is inside the
system call dispatcher before it executes iret. That is, when a process
returns from a system call (e.g., after sleeping) the system call
dispatcher checks before executing iret if the current process has 
registered callback functions and their relevant signals have been 
raised. If so, the dispatcher modifies the stack so that upon
executing iret a detour to a callback function is made. Since iret
untraps to user mode, the callback function is executed in user
context thus preserving isolation/protection.
</p>

<p>
Effecting a detour to a callback function after which a process is made
to resume where it left off is related to the clandestine attack in Problem
5.2 of lab4. Software engineering techniques are just that: techniques. 
They may be used for good or bad. To build software that can withstand
malicious attacks one must understand the techniques employed by hackers.
To mount an effective attack, a hacker must understand the techniques
utilized by software engineers to build production systems.
There is an endless race to achieve the upper hand.
The specific ROP technique we will use in lab5 to implement detour may
not be the method that you used in lab4. We will utilize a technique
where the run-time stack is modified once by the system call dispatcher
before executing iret. The modification will cause iret to jump to
the callback function. When the callback function has completed and
executes ret, it will jump back to the original return address of
iret. No extra modification of the stack is needed after the first
jump to achieve the second jump.
</p>

<p>
We will be implementing the detour for legacy XINU system calls which
are regular C functions, not trapped XINU system calls that we implemented
in lab2. This means that the detour is not effected by the system call
dispatcher but at the end of a system call before it executes ret. To
keep coding minimal, we will only consider the blocking system call
sleepms(). All other blocking system calls may be modified in the same
manner. We will define the boundary between user context and kernel
context in the sleepms() XINU system call when it executes ret after
calling resched(), blocking, returning from resched(), and
calling restore(). Thus the main difference is ret instead of 
iret in trapped system calls. The machine code of sleepms() is generated
by gcc and before executing the last instruction ret the stack pointer
ESP must point to the top of the stack where the return address to
the caller of sleepms() is located. We will grow the stack by 4 bytes
by pushing the address of the callback function. Since ESP points to
the callback function, executing ret in sleepms() will cause a jump
to the callback function and ESP will point to the original
return address in the stack. The callback function does what it does
and when it executes the last instruction ret ESP is guaranteed to
point to the original return address. Hence the callback function
jumps to the original return address where the caller of sleepms()
continues where it left off.
</p>

<p>
<b>Case (ii): clock interrupt</b>
Case (i) concerned when a process that registered a callback function
returns from the upper half of the kernel. Case (ii) concerns the lower
half where the process may have been context-switched out because it
depleted its time slice, or a blocked process (e.g., sleeping) of
higher priority than the current process wakes up and preempts the
current process. Since we are using sleepms() as the canonical example
of blocking system calls, both depletion of time slice and
preemption by a higher priority process are effected by clock
interrupt handling in the lower half. Thus code modifications must
be made inside clkdisp.S before iret to check whether a detour needs
to be made, and, if so, induce it through a one-time stack 
manipulation similar (but not identical) to case (i). 
</p>

<p>
The boundary
between user context and kernel context in XINU (and Linux/Windows
on x86) is execution of iret in the lower half. clkdisp.S makes
sure that ESP points to the top of stack where the return address
is located before executing iret. Unlike case (i), however, below
the return address in the stack reside the content of CS and EFLAGS
which were saved by x86 when a clock interrupt occurred. We know
from lab2 that iret atomically pops the return address, CS, and
EFLAGS. We need to modify the stack so that when executing iret
and changing to user context we jump to the callback function
in addition to popping CS and EFLAGS. We achieve this goal by
growing the stack by 4 bytes and "shifting" CS and EFLAGS by 4 bytes
(toward the top of the stack). This leaves a hole of 4 bytes
where EFLAGS previously resided. We copy the original return
address into this hole. At the top of the stack, we write the
address of the callback function.
When clkdisp.S executes iret, it atomically pops the callback
function's return address, original CS, original EFLAGS, and
jumps to the callback function.
ESP points to the original return address.
When the callback function executes ret, it causes a jump
to the original return address as in case (i).
</p>

<p>
In case (i) and (ii), if both SIGIPC and SIGCHLD are raised then
their respective callback functions have been registered, a detour is
made for SIGIPC only. SIGCHLD is handled the next time the process
goes through the checks of case (i) and (ii). That is, after the process
is context-switched out and becomes current. A more general solution
where both signals are handled back to back can be implemented by
not jumping to signal handlers directly but by jumping to a signal
handler dispatcher function (kernel code running in user mode)
which then calls signal handlers as needed. The signal dispatcher
function then returns to the original return address. We will
not implement the general solution in this problem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Case (iii): divide-by-zero exception</b>
We considered x86 exception 0 in lab2 where _Xint0 in intr.S was
modified to affect different responses to the interrupt by the lower
half of the kernel. Modify _Xint0 so that it performs similar tasks
as clkdisp.S and modifies the run-time stack once before executing 
iret which causes a jump to the user's callback function. For
exception 0 the callback function can perform relevant tasks 
(e.g., to determine what may have caused divide by zero) before
calling exit() to terminate the process. If the app programmer
does not call exit(), the callback function upon executin ret
will jump to the original return address which triggers yet another
divide-by-zero exception. We will not modify the original return
address so that ret jumps to the next instruction of divide-by-zero.

<p>
Test your implementation to check that your kernel modifications
to support asynchronous event processing using callback function (synchronous
event processing being a simpler case) works correctly.
Describe in lab5.pdf the test scenarios you have considered to
establish correctness.

<h2>Bonus problem [60 pts]</h2>

<p>
XINU uses getmem() to allocate heap memory from a single
linked list of free memory segments and freemem() to return
unused memory to the free memory pool. The kernel keeps track of
per-process stack memory so that when a process terminates its stack
memory is returned to the free memory list via freestk().
This is not the case, however, for memory allocated by
getmem() which gets only freed if a process explicitly
deallocates memory by calling freemem() which is
voluntary. 
That is, when a process terminates any dynamic memory that it was
allocated but has not freed remains allocated (see the actions
of kill() which cleans up when a process terminates).
Even when an application programmer
ardently tries to free allocated memory before exiting,
programming mistakes and bugs may result in build-up of memory garbage.
</p>

<p>
In our setting of garbage memory collection in XINU,
we are tackling a modest problem of
ensuring that all memory allocated to a process through getmem(),
irrespective of whether freed by a process, are reclaimed by XINU when the process terminates.
This eliminates memory leakage by implementing
garbage collection inside the kernel.
To do so, XINU must track
dynamic memory allocation and deallocation on a per-process basis 
and return any unfreed memory to the free list 
when a process terminates. 
</p>

<p>
Design and implement garbage collection support
in XINU by modifying the system calls,
getmem() and freemem(), and relevant parts
of the kernel so that kill() reclaims any unfreed memory
allocated through getmem(). Describe your design
including data structure of keep track of allocated memory
in lab5.pdf.
Evaluate your garbage collection enabled XINU kernel on 
test cases where app processes omit freemem() system
calls.
Describe the test cases that you used to establish correctness.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>
